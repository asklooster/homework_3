Folder contains project materials for creating a simulation model for a
theoretical coffee shop. Notebook folder contains 5 iterations of the same model.
'cafe_version_4.ipynb' is the finished product. All other notebooks are in folder
'old_versions'.

The latest model will automatically produce CSV file containing simulation results.
This file will be saved in 'output' folder.

Given more time, I would've migrated notebook to a .py file and
try replicating command line functionality found in vaccine clinic model.


Thanks for everything Professor! These last three classes have given me a lot to
draw from and plenty of points for continued study. Have a great rest of your
summer!
